# Vaccinometer
The Project is Vaccinometer.
This is a Blockchain-based project that works on the web.
Vaccines or medicines are always needed to be pure, not adulterated. But there is no way a user sitting at his home can track where the vaccine came from, which manufacturer made this, which hospitals it reached, and all about that.
Vaccinometer does this work easy for users and shows a way to have transparency between manufacturer and user.
When Manufacturer or Hospital simply scanned the medicine's QR Code and the web-app stores it into its database the location, the identification of the person, and the date when they scanned the vaccines and all the details.
So by simply scanning the QR code, the user gets all its details easily.
As blockchain is decentralized and of secure nature, storing the information without any 3rd party help to ensure more security.
This Code Sample consists of files for both the backend and front end of the project with blockchain integrated into the back end.
The Tech Stack used for the project is Frontend (React JS) and Backend(Flask- Python Based) with Database as Postgres SQL with Blockchain (Solidity).
